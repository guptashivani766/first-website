    <h2>Taj Mahal, Agra </h2>
    <p>One can go on praising the Taj Mahal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with an uninterrupted flow of adjectives – magnificent, outstanding, amazing and incredible. However, none of those can accurately do justice to its beauty. The only way to do that is to visit this incredible structure made of pure white marble. Everything about it reflects grandeur, from its minarets to its dome.

        Shah Jahan had this monument built for his wife Mumtaz to express his undying love for her, and today, lovers cite this as an example when expressing their love to each other. The construction of the Taj Mahal, which is also one of the must visit UNESCO World Heritage Sites In India, took around 22 years to complete, and no wonder, the effort of every year is reflected in its construction.
        
        Do you know? Inspired by the Taj Mahal, Dubai is planning to build a hotel and shopping complex which is estimated to be four times larger than the original structure.

        <h2>Hawa Mahal, Jaipur        </h2>
        <p>The royal class has always had its own way of doing things, and so did the royal ladies of Jaipur. Jaipur is also one of the most popular historic places in India. Belonging to royalty required them to observe the “purdah” system constantly. However, they were also curious about the happenings of the outside world. To satisfy this curiosity, Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh had the Hawa Mahal built for them.

            Upon visiting it the first time, you will notice that the Hawa Mahal also looks like a crown. This is because the Maharaja who built it was a major devotee of Lord Krishna. Also known as the “Palace of Winds”, it was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. It resembles a honeycomb of a beehive with its 953 intricate windows. Upon visiting it the first time, you will notice that the Hawa Mahal is shaped like a crown. Explore popular attractions in Jaipur with this package.

                <h2>Fatehpur Sikri, Agra   </h2>
                <p>The Mughals can be credited with having built some of the finest monuments in India, and Fatehpur Sikri, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is yet another example of that. Although, it should be said that it is more a small city than just a monument. Built during the reign of Akbar, this royal city is home to several buildings like Birbal’s Palace, Tomb of Salim Chisti and Jama Masjid.

                    This royal city, which, for a brief period of time, served as the capital city of Akbar, today wears a look of melancholy while its rich sandstone walls reflect the glory of a past age. You will also come across the place where Tansen, the legendary singer, practiced his singing. Watch out for the Buland Darwaza at the entrance, which measures almost 54 meters.
                    
                    Do you know? It is believed that many women, who were unable to give birth to a child, would come to the tomb of Salim Chisti to seek blessings.
                    
                    Don’t miss: Two of the buildings which you must check out on your visit here are Diwan-i-Aam and Diwan-i-Khas.
